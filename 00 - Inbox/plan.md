# OCTOPUS Swarm Plan — Phase 0 → Phase 1

## System Map (Quick Discovery)
- `F:/backup/4d_system/` — core brain (daemon, budget, frontier, events, guardrails, hypotheses, autoloop, autoloop, agents)
- `F:/backup/07 - Knowledge/genome-system/` — research_loop.py, run.py
- `F:/backup/07 - Knowledge/school-memory/` — curriculum.py
- `F:/backup/04 - Architect System/scripts/` — budget_gate.py, dashboard_doctor.py, genome_guard.py, governor_shadow.py
- `F:/backup/_ops/` — operations state (ORGANISM-STATE, fitness, cardiac-budget, chrono, events)
- `F:/backup/OCTOPUS/` — visualization hub (10 worlds + nervous-system + extractors)
- `F:/backup/03 - Projects/` — Lead, Mining, Crypto, Ziman, OnlyFans (pruned from graph)
- `F:/backup/05 - Agents/`, `06 - Architecture Maps/`, `01 - Dashboard/`, `02 - Life OS/`

## 15 Channels (Draft)
1. 4d_system/outputs → nervous-system/live-data.js (extractor pipeline) — EXISTS, needs hardening
2. _ops/state → nervous-system/ops-data.js (extractor pipeline) — EXISTS, needs hardening
3. vault/md → OCTOPUS/graph-data.js (extractor pipeline) — EXISTS, needs hardening
4. Telegram bot → langar command router → brain_router → MeteredBrainProvider — PARTIAL
5. 4d_system brain events → SQLite dashboard_events → live-data.js → OCTOPUS vitals — EXISTS
6. genome-system research_loop → genome-system/ledger → Obsidian notes — PARTIAL
7. _ops/ORGANISM-STATE → fitness-latest → admin dashboard health scoring — PARTIAL
8. Mining fleet telemetry → _ops/state → OCTOPUS risk world — MISSING
9. Wallet/transaction events → _ops/money → OCTOPUS money world — MISSING
10. Code repo changes → git hooks → 4d_system self-evolution proposals — MISSING
11. Agent telemetry → tracer.py → event_log → audit dashboard — MISSING
12. Vault note updates → indexer.py → FTS5 → semantic search API — PARTIAL
13. Cron jobs → ai.daily_question → research_loop → decision_packets — MISSING
14. HITL/Owner-Gate → approval queue → Telegram notification → owner verdict — MISSING
15. Cross-world navigation signals → nextAction() → cockpit recommendations — MISSING

## Swarm Assignment
- Agent 1: Vault Cartographer → full inventory + dependency map
- Agent 2: Admin Environment Integrator → inspect existing admin UI + langar bot + dashboard
- Agent 3: Channel Architect → formalize 15 channel specs with code targets
- Agent 4: Code Builder Swarm → implement highest-priority channels (1-5 + 8-10)
- Agent 5: Obsidian Steward → update vault structure for all new channels
- Agent 6: Wallet/Finance/Mining Connector → money + mining channels
- Agent 7: 2027 Strategy Synthesizer → rank and prioritize build waves

## Status Update (2026-07-13)
- Phase 0 (Discovery): COMPLETE — 3 sub-agents produced full system map + 18 channel specs
- Wave 1 (P0 extractors + data backbone): COMPLETE — extract_live_data.py, extract_ops_data.py, extract_graph.py, octo-data.js, shared-ui.js deployed
- Wave 2 (P1 channels): IN PROGRESS — launching Code Builder Swarm
- Telegram Admin UI: IN PROGRESS — building unified admin dashboard
- Next: CH-14 (HITL queue), CH-04 (Telegram unify), CH-07 (Health score), CH-10 (Git watcher), CH-11 (Tracer), CH-16 (Neural), CH-17 (Watchdog)

## Swarm Assignment
- Agent 1: Vault Cartographer → COMPLETE
- Agent 2: Admin Environment Integrator → COMPLETE
- Agent 3: Channel Architect → COMPLETE
- Agent 4: Code Builder Swarm → IN PROGRESS (CH-14, CH-04, CH-07, CH-10, CH-11, CH-16, CH-17)
- Agent 5: Obsidian Steward → PENDING
- Agent 6: Wallet/Finance/Mining Connector → PENDING
- Agent 7: 2027 Strategy Synthesizer → PENDING

## Next Actions
1. Launch Code Builder Swarm on Wave 2 channels (parallel)
2. Build Telegram Admin UI (unified dashboard)
3. Launch Obsidian Steward in parallel with coding
4. Merge and test

1. Launch Vault Cartographer + Admin Integrator + Channel Architect in parallel
2. Merge their outputs into a single channel table
3. Launch Code Builder Swarm on approved channels
4. Launch Obsidian Steward + Finance Connector in parallel with coding
